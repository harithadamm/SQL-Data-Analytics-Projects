# Data Warehouse Sales EDA & Insights

## 📖 Executive Summary
This project explores a retail data warehouse dataset using SQL‑based exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
The dataset is structured in a **fact‑dimension model**, enabling analysis of customer behavior, product performance, regional sales, and profitability.  

The objective is to demonstrate how SQL EDA can uncover hidden patterns in a warehouse environment and translate them into **business insights** that drive strategic decisions.
